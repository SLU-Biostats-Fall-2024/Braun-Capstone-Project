I think the problem you are running into is the overwhelming difference in the number of samples b/w no diabetes and having diabetes. Statistically speaking, because of the overwhelming number of cases, there is just not that great an odds of being diagnosed overall, so even though you got a meaningful statistically significan result, your plot never approaches 1 (code at line 391 in your final analysis qmd).

Your analysis looks correct, and we can see that increasing bmi increases the p of being diagnosed.

So I'd go through and write up this model. It is telling us a lot, actually, even though the figure doesn't look as expected.
